<<<<<<< HEAD
Just a bit of playing around with HTML to make my AP Statistics projects easier
This is where I will store any websites that I use for stats project, along with a little playing around I did with JS.

Used code from:
https://codemyui.com/slot-machine-text-animation/

Attempted to use code from:
https://github.com/josex2r/jQuery-SlotMachine

=======
I play around with HTML to build parts of websites to make AP Statistics projects easier for me. I also try out some NodeJS in this repository.
